## 1. HOOK (30 sec)
**Goal:** Establish relatability and introduce the project name

- ✅ Open with shared frustration: "We all see the same dumpsites every day"
- ✅ Pose the question: "What if cleanup was a competitive sport?"
- ✅ State name & tagline: **"VukaMap — Wake up the map. Clean up the Kasi."**

**Key Phrase:** *"Turn frustration into action"*

---

## 2. THE PROBLEM (40 sec)
**Goal:** Validate the pain point with specificity

- ❌ Traditional reporting systems are **slow & disconnected**
